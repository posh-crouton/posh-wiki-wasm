Spoiler alert for Star Trek: Discovery, Season 4. 

From the very start, and to varying degrees throughout, the plot of this book felt like the plot of Star Trek: Discovery's fourth season. Extra-galactic beings send a destructive force into the Milky Way with apathy for the native species it may affect, and are thwarted by a Federation. 

In the beginning, I appreciated the book's at least passing semblance of scientific realism. It named real stars, stars which I have no reason not to believe were described inaccurately, and used sensible measures like "lightspeeds", even if some of the mathematics was a little off (for example, it would take over 18 days to travel from Proxima Centauri to Sol at 80c, not a few hours). This kind of fell off as the story progressed, with the mention of an "ether", a concept that will pain anyone with at least a passing familiaity of the history of astronomy. 

I did enjoy the pacing of the book. It feels like it wouldn't have to sacrifice much of anything if it was a movie, even with the modern time constraints of 60-90 minutes. It might even have fit well as a two-parter in a longer series. In fact, I'd be intrigued to learn if there are any more works set in the same universe - it's no Trek, but it's definitely something I'd read more of.
