As it is for a lot of people, my annual review at work happens in April. As such, the time leading up to it is a good time for self-reflection. I can't share too many details, but this financial year, I've been solely responsible for a complete rewrite of a complex piece of software. 

Of course, I have to offload some blame - the existing systems I've had to integrate with are horribly poorly designed, and documentation was wholly non-existent. That said, in retrospect, there were definitely some opportunities where I could have made smarter decisions to make it easier for myself down the line. 

Historically, I've done development in ways where I haven't needed to concern myself with architecture - combining several smaller individual programs, writing simple programs that do just one thing (see UNIX philosophy), or modifying a small part of a larger pre-existing codebase. These days, I feel like the barrier to becoming more advanced and independent in the type of work I do is my limited understanding of architectural practices in the ecosystems I'm working in. 

This book taught me a lot about APIs in .NET MAUI I wouldn't have known about otherwise. It hasn't been my favourite UI framework from the beginning, just as a matter of personal preference, but I feel like a lot of what I've learned here will make it significantly nicer to use. 

On top of that, some of the patterns and practices here aren't specific to MAUI, and can be used in a variety of desktop and mobile UI frameworks. I learned a decent bit about the offerings of the Community Toolkit packages, which I've historically neglected. Overall, I learned a good bit about architecting native GUI applications.
