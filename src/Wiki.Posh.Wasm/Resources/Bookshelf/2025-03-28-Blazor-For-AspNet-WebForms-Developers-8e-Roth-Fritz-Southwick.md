## Blazor for ASP.NET Web Forms Developers, 8th Edition 
<span class="text-secondary">by Daniel Roth, Jeff Fritz, and Taylor Southwick</span>

This ebook is available for free at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/blazor-for-web-forms-developers/. 

This is the second book in a row I've read about software architecture. While native GUI apps is the main part of my job, I also do a small bit of work on web apps. I may not be an ASP.NET WebForms developer, but I thought I could still get a thing or two from this book. 

The first thing I'll note is that this book doesn't at all mention the latest and greatest of Blazor. They released a lot in 2023 at .NET Conf along with .NET 8, and it doesn't look like this book has been updated to include it. 

I did learn a bit about how Blazor seems far less restrictive in terms of architecture than most historical .NET web frameworks, as well as Blazor's built-in components, as well as the @attributes feature, but gained relatively little in terms of architectural knowledge. 

I don't think I'll be reading the other 3 [ebooks on .NET architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/), simply because the topics are not at all relevant to me. Containerisation, cloud-native, and Azure aren't really technologies I work with, nor do I see myself pivoting to work with them in the near future. That said, it's probably not the last book on software architecture I'll ever read.
