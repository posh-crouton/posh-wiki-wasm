## Nineteen Eighty-Four
<span class="text-secondary">by George Orwell</span>

I read this book in part because I've seen a lot of reference to it recently in connection with the UK's increasing climate of surveillance, and in part because it was suggested by a friend that I compare it with Huxley's *Brave New World*. 

Some of the comments about society and economics in this book make me realise why Orwell's works were banned in the USA for being anti-capitalist and the USSR for being anti-communist (the true nature of the works, of course, being anti-authoritarian). 

Some of the comments made by Winston - especially the one about his thoughts of raping and murdering Julia - were quite off-putting. I'm not sure if these were a function of the time in which the book was written, of the setting of the story, or a mix of the two. 

I feel like "there are four lights" (from star trek) is almost a direct reference to Winston's interrogation - which makes it rather coincidental that his interrogator is called O'Brien.
