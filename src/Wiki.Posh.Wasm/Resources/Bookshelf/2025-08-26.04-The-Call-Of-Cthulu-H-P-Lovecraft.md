I've never really been into horror in general. It's not that I have a particular aversion to it, but rather, a lack of a particular interest. The Call Of Cthulu makes me feel like this opinion may be born of the tendencies of the medium I'm used to, as I've never really been one for jumpscares or suspenseful cinematography. Despite having read Steven King's tips on writing, I've never read any of his works before, or any other work of written horror fiction, but after *The Call of Cthulu*, that might be about to change.
