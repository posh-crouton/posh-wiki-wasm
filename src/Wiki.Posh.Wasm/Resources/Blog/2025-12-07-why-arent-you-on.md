> Hey Posh, why aren't you on Twitter? 

First off, if I see anyone calling it X, I am going to go on a very long rant about how I'll respect Elon's site's name once he starts to respect Vivian's. 

And that brings us nicely into the first reason: Elon. Even if I block ads and don't buy Twitter premium, Elon would still manage to profit from me using Twitter, and I don't want to give that man a single cent if I can help it. 

The app has also gotten significantly worse over time. In my last days of using it, when I clicked on a notification, it would often just show me "the quoted post isn't available". The posts were definitely still there - I could go back and look up the account, and more often than not, I would find a post matching the preview that I was shown. Messages also seem to not come through great, and many components of the app are just web views these days. 

Even before Elon bought it, the Twitter algorithm seemed not great. I believe at some point they open-sourced it, and it was designed to specifically show content that didn't align with users' political opinions to drive engagement. 

I do keep a twitter account, @poshdotwiki, but you won't find me very active on there. I only use that account to look at things people have directly sent to me, talk with artists, and occasionally do recon to form my own opinions if someone's getting cancelled. 

> Hey Posh, why aren't you on DeviantArt? 

Quite simply because I can't be. 

DeviantArt doesn't like when I use a VPN or tor, and I'm not sacrificing my online anonymity to get around the age verification rules my country demands for potentially explicit content. 

> Hey Posh, why aren't you on Mastodon? 

Because BlueSky won. 

ActivityPub is great as a protocol conceptually, but there's no hype around the ecosystem. It doesn't seem to be going anywhere at any significant pace, and I feel like that contributes to its lack of popularity. 

Plus, I've tried mastodon in the past, and every instance I've been on has died, and I'm not about to commit to hosting my own instance just so I can keep my account. 

> Hey Posh, why aren't you on Tumblr? 

I am! I just browse, though. I don't contribute to the ecosystem at all, so I don't associate it with any of my other presences.
