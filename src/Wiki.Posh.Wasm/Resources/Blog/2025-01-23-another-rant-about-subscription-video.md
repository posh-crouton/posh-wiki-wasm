title: Another Rant, This Time About Subscription Video Services
---

<p>
    This originally started as a small anecdote for a friend's English class, but I accidentally
    wrote a bit too much.
</p>

<p>
    In 2022, media company Paramount pulled several series, including the still-airing Star
    Trek: Discovery, from Netflix, in an effort to ~~force~~ draw new customers to their own
    streaming service, Paramount+. At launch, this service was only available in the USA,
    meaning that the roughly 95% of the world's non-American population would be unable to watch
    the show, sparking outrage among fans. You couldn't even use a VPN to get around it, since
    you needed a valid US credit card to sign up.
</p>

<p>
    In July 2024, Radio Times reported that a single month of Prime Video would set you back
    £8.99. At the time of writing, Paramount+ markets its cheapest plan at £4.99 per month. This
    brings the total cost of accessing the service to £13.98 per month. On top of the base
    subscription price, certain shows and seasons have been left out of this package deal. I
    remember being unable to watch season 3 and 4 of Star Trek: The Lower Decks, as Amazon
    wanted almost £20 per season. Oh, and, there are still ads.
</p>

<p>
    With over 26 full days worth of video content across the Star Trek cinematic universe, even
    the most dedicated of viewers would need to pay at least 2 months' subscription fee (nearly
    thirty pounds) for the opportunity to watch all of it. Watching at a more reasonable 24
    hours per month, around one episode per day for the longer shows, will cost you a total
    £419.40. Doing the maths, this works out at around £1.52 per hour of video. Keep in mind,
    this is a generously low estimate of the cost. Note that this is a generous estimate, and
    does not take into account the inevitable price hikes or any seasons sold separately.
</p>

<p>
    In comparison, all 130 hours of my current watch, Star Trek: Voyager, are available as a DVD
    box set for £59.99 on Amazon. This works out as around 38p per hour of video. In other
    words, if Prime and Paramount+ offered all of Trek at the £13.98 per month price, one would
    need to spend 96 hours (4 days) per month to make the subscription worth more than
    purchasing box sets at Voyager's price-per-hour.
</p>

<p>
    We were sold subscription services under the guise that they were cheaper and more
    convenient than physical media. In fact, the opposite is true, up to a threshold most people
    won't meet.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, this won't hold true for everything. Many movies and series have only ever been
    available on streaming services (see: Star Trek: Section 31, which releases tomorrow
    exclusively on Paramount+). Shorter series are also more likely to be better valued on a
    subscription service than in purchased physical media. Still, the fact that this can happen
    at all? Feels like a scam that I can pay less for a better experience in such a significant
    number of cases.
</p>

<p>
    So, friendly reminder to own physical media where you can. Get yourself a cheap blu-ray
    player (not all DVD players support blu-ray!) and save money in the long term.
