title: Devlog 1 - The Ennamening 
--- 

Yes, I'm afraid they'll all be named this way. I recently watched Wicked for the first time, and I find it funny how they mispronouncify words for seemingly no reason. 

This is devlog #1 of my non-denominational December holiday project, in which I make simple CRUD and IX functionality for my tag-based resource cateloging engine, which is finally getting a name: Taggart! This name was suggested by my friend Jack, who expressed opposition to being named in this post. It's inspired by the *Fallout: New Vegas* character Head Scribe Lars Taggart, who is voiced by the prolific Yuri Lowenthal, who haunts every piece of media I've ever engaged with. 

## The Tests 

### Tests That Maybe Should Have Been Analyzers 

Admittedly, I wrote a few tests which might have been better in the form of analyzers. 

In the application logic, all operations are organised into services and defined as service method, each of which takes a *Request parameter and returns a *Result report. All requests and result types should be sealed records, meaning that they can't be inherited, and an equality check will check the equivalence of data in the object even though it's passed around as a reference type. Results also need to inherit the ResultBase type, which defines some core properties common to all results. 

I wrote some tests to assert these constraints, but in retrospect, they might have been better as analyzers. Since the tests are purely reflective and don't require the application of any logic beyond what exists in the C# specification, a custom analyzer would have offered the benefit of immediate feedback. They may be a bit of a pain to write and not work everywhere, but if there's anywhere they're good for, it's probably here. 

### Database Tests 

To organise records by date, save a little space, and most importantly to eliminate the need for a round-trip to a database to get a key for a record, I decided to have all table keys be GUID v7s. I wrote a test to generate a million instances of each table type and check that the first character of the third group was 7 (a requirement of the UUID v7 spec). The chance of a false positive on this test would be 1 in (15/16)<sup>1,000,000</sup>, which 1.89*10<sup>-28027</sup>%\*.

I also asserted that all data tables implement the "restrict" delete behaviour, for reasons that will become apparent later. 

### Application Logic

The application logic was decent to test here. All there was to it was setting up the database, performing a single service operation, and then asserting that the database was in the expected state. 

This might be the most tests I've ever written for everything I've ever done, really. 

### CLI Interaction 

Testing CLI interaction is brilliant! It's far easier than a GUI or a TUI. It's essentially the same as testing application logic: Setup a database, call `Program.Main(["create", "resource", "/path/to/file"])` (or whatever feature I'm testing), and then assert! 

I wish testing for my job would be this easy. Unfortunately, I have to write GUI apps with horribly untestable frameworks. 

### Cli Docs 

One of the most difficult things in a project, especially one so young and rapidly evolving as Tagart, is keeping good documentation. CLI apps lend themselves quite well to this, since with a good framework like System.CommandLine it's very possible to have user documentation live next to or inside of the commands, arguments, and options they describe. 

I wrote a suite of tests to make sure that every part of the CLI at least had *some* documentation defined, and updated the descriptions as the interface evolved. As for API documentation for the application layer... there isn't any yet. 

## The Interface 

I ended up making several changes from my original plan for the command line interface. 

For resources, the `taggart resource create` command now requires tags to apply to the resource. There's no use in having a resource you can't search for later. The `taggart resource update` command has also been updated to use the syntax `taggart resource update /path/to/resource +newTag -oldTag`. 

The tag command has been almost completely gutted. There's no reason for a tag to exist if it isn't assigned to a resource, to tag creation can only happen when adding a nonexistent tag to a resource. There's no metadata about a tag to update, either, so the only commands that survived are "rename" and "delete". 

I decided to ditch importing and exporting the database as well. I decided that this shouldn't be the responsibility of the app, since most good database implmentations have mechanisms to back up and restore their data. I did add the `taggart database cleanup` command, as explained later in this post. 

## The Database 

I initially thought that the database would be rather simple. I'd need two data tables and one junction table - simple! Unfortunately, it seems I needed to make some adjustments based on another decision I'd made. 

### The Investigation 

Entity Framework is an object-relational mapping library for .NET. It lets you abstract away the specific database implementation and focus on the actual data, meaning you don't need to learn quite so much about database technologies or protecting against query injection. 

This project taught me that EF isn't just a glorified version of the repository pattern (another method to de-couple database access and business logic). It's more opinionated than I previously thought, as illustrated by how the default delete behaviour is cascading. 

I used code first (i.e., using CLR classes annotated with EF attributes and a model configured with the fluent API) to define the database schema. For performance, I used navigation properties, meaning that the types referenced other rich types or collections of types, which enabled me to query related data in a way that would be optimised by EF's query translator. I did define my junction table explicitly, in case I wanted to expand the relation with metadata later on. 

Initially, I assumed that deleting a resource by means of `ctx.Resources.Remove(resource)` would be translated into a query like `DELETE FROM [Taggart].[dbo].[ResourceTable] WHERE ID = '0000-...'`. I thought that any relevant junctions - named `ResourceTableTagTable` - would be left alone, and that I'd have to clean up later. It turns out I was wrong on that! 

During testing, I noticed that whenever I deleted a resource, all relevant junctions would also disappear. I looked through the resource service, and through the test, and made sure so many times that the test method was creating a fresh database.

### The Diagnosis 

Eventually I found out that it was because EF, in the absence of being told otherwise, had configured the relation with a cascade delete. When a record is deleted and cascade is enabled, all other database records with a foreign key to said record are deleted. 

One might think that's all well and good - it means that there can never be a dangling reference. While that is a benefit to cascading, it's also just a little bit slower, because it has to look up foreign key references. I wanted Taggart to remain performance critical at scale, making the cheapest possible queries, so I tried to turn cascade off. 

Initially, I tried to change the delete behaaviour to "restrict". It turns out that restricting means that it's impossible to delete a record while any foreign key references it. I didn't want to use SetNull, because nulls are evil and I honestly don't know why I haven't committed to Rust yet. 

### The Treatment 

The final solution I ended up with was using restrictive deletion and adding soft delete to the tables. For ResourceTable and TagTable, I aded a global filter of `IsDeleted == NoYes.No` (might as well use an Enum since a boolean/bit wastes at least 7 bits in most cases). 

Now, the act of deleting a record or tag doesn't remove it from the database, but instead sets IsDeleted to Yes. That way, the deleted rows, and junctions pointing to them, won't show up in queries by default. 

### The Cleanup Job 

Now I had a bunch of soft-deleted records and dangling references laying around, taking up space in the database. I needed a way to clean these up. 

I considered writing a separate program, a daemon that would monitor the database and perform maintenance, but I thought that was a bit much. Instead, I ended up adding the command `taggart database cleanup`, which allows multiple different "targets" to be run in a custom order. I added targets for deleting dangling references and hard-deleting soft deleted rows. 

This way, database operations remain as fast as they can be, and anyone concerned with cleaning up their database can either do so on command or configure a cron job to invoke the cleanup command on a schedule that makes sense to them. 

## Potential Improvements 

One place that left something to be desired in this stage was logging. It works, sure, but I feel like the IOC is a bit dirty. I'd like to spend some time learning about logging providers, so I don't have to rely on the interface layer(s) to provide an ILoggerFactory, but instead have them subscribe to a logger that's managed by the application layer. 

I'd also like to learn more about EF migrations. I had to delete my database quite a few times as I was working out the quirks of the quirks, and I'm almost definitely going to make some breaking changes in future, so a safe way to make those would be great. 

I'd also like to test better for every supported database implementation. I've been using SQLite because I can't be bothered setting up a docker container with SQL server, but there's a few other providers that come bundled and configurable. EF translation varies based on what each implementation supports, and there's no guarantee that my SQLite-compatible queries will work with any other database. I could probably do this with Docker, if I could be bothered to use it. 

The final thing I'd like to get onto is benchmarking, but that would require some big data. Maybe I'll download some metadata using an existing site's API and create some scripts to add it in, because I'm very curious to see how my implementation will perform at scale.
