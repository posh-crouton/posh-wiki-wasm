title: Devlog 1 - The Ennamening 
--- 

Yes, I'm afraid they'll all be named this way. I recently watched Wicked for the first time, and I find it funny how they mispronouncify words for seemingly no reason. 

This is devlog #1 of my non-denominational December holiday project, in which I make simple CRUD and IX functionality for my tag-based resource cateloging engine, which is finally getting a name: Taggart! This name was suggested by my friend Jack, who expressed opposition to being named in this post. It's inspired by the *Fallout: New Vegas* character Head Scribe Lars Taggart, who is voiced by the prolific Yuri Lowenthal, who haunts every piece of media I've ever engaged with. 

## The Tests 

### Tests That Maybe Should Have Been Analyzers 

Admittedly, I wrote a few tests which might have been better in the form of analyzers. 

In the application logic, all operations are organised into services and defined as service method, each of which takes a *Request parameter and returns a *Result report. All requests and result types should be sealed records, meaning that they can't be inherited, and an equality check will check the equivalence of data in the object even though it's passed around as a reference type. Results also need to inherit the ResultBase type, which defines some core properties common to all results. 

I wrote some tests to assert these constraints, but in retrospect, they might have been better as analyzers. Since the tests are purely reflective and don't require the application of any logic beyond what exists in the C# specification, a custom analyzer would have offered the benefit of immediate feedback. They may be a bit of a pain to write and not work everywhere, but if there's anywhere they're good for, it's probably here. 

### Database Tests 

To organise records by date, save a little space, and most importantly to eliminate the need for a round-trip to a database to get a key for a record, I decided to have all table keys be GUID v7s. I wrote a test to generate a million instances of each table type and check that the first character of the third group was 7 (a requirement of the UUID v7 spec). The chance of a false positive on this test would be 1 in (15/16)<sup>1,000,000</sup>, which 1.89*10<sup>-28027</sup>%\*.

### Application Logic

### Cli Docs 

## The Interface 

I ended up making several changes from my original plan for the command line interface. 

For resources, the `taggart resource create` command now requires tags to apply to the resource. There's no use in having a resource you can't search for later. The `taggart resource update` command has also been updated to use the syntax `taggart resource update /path/to/resource +newTag -oldTag`. 

The tag command has been almost completely gutted. There's no reason for a tag to exist if it isn't assigned to a resource, to tag creation can only happen when adding a nonexistent tag to a resource. There's no metadata about a tag to update, either, so the only commands that survived are "rename" and "delete". 

I decided to ditch importing and exporting the database as well. I decided that this shouldn't be the responsibility of the app, since most good database implmentations have mechanisms to back up and restore their data. I did add the `taggart database cleanup` command, as explained later in this post. 

## The Database 

I initially thought that the database would be rather simple. I'd need two data tables and one junction table - simple! Unfortunately, it seems I needed to make some adjustments based on another decision I'd made. 

### The Investigation 

Entity Framework is an object-relational mapping library for .NET. It lets you abstract away the specific database implementation and focus on the actual data, meaning you don't need to learn quite so much about database technologies or protecting against query injection. 

This project taught me that EF isn't just a glorified version of the repository pattern (another method to de-couple database access and business logic). It's more opinionated than I previously thought, as illustrated by how the default delete behaviour is cascading. 

I used code first (i.e., using CLR classes annotated with EF attributes and a model configured with the fluent API) to define the database schema. For performance, I used navigation properties, meaning that the types referenced other rich types or collections of types, which enabled me to query related data in a way that would be optimised by EF's query translator. I did define my junction table explicitly, in case I wanted to expand the relation with metadata later on. 

Initially, I assumed that deleting a resource by means of `ctx.Resources.Remove(resource)` would be translated into a query like `DELETE FROM [Taggart].[dbo].[ResourceTable] WHERE ID = '0000-...'`. I thought that any relevant junctions - named `ResourceTableTagTable` - would be left alone, and that I'd have to clean up later. It turns out I was wrong on that! 

During testing, I noticed that whenever I deleted a resource, all relevant junctions would also disappear. I looked through the resource service, and through the test, and made sure so many times that the test method was creating a fresh database.

### The Diagnosis 

Eventually I found out that it was because EF, in the absence of being told otherwise, had configured the relation with a cascade delete. When a record is deleted and cascade is enabled, all other database records with a foreign key to said record are deleted. 

One might think that's all well and good - it means that there can never be a dangling reference. While that is a benefit to cascading, it's also just a little bit slower, because it has to look up foreign key references. I wanted Taggart to remain performance critical at scale, making the cheapest possible queries, so I tried to turn cascade off. 

Initially, I tried to change the delete behaaviour to "restrict". It turns out that restricting means that it's impossible to delete a record while any foreign key references it. I didn't want to use SetNull, because nulls are evil and I honestly don't know why I haven't committed to Rust yet. 

### The Treatment 

The final solution I ended up with was using restrictive deletion and adding soft delete to the tables. For ResourceTable and TagTable, I aded a global filter of `IsDeleted == NoYes.No` (might as well use an Enum since a boolean/bit wastes at least 7 bits in most cases). 

Now, the act of deleting a record or tag doesn't remove it from the database, but instead sets IsDeleted to Yes. That way, the deleted rows, and junctions pointing to them, won't show up in queries by default. 

### The Cleanup Job 

Now I had a bunch of soft-deleted records and dangling references laying around, taking up space in the database. I needed a way to clean these up. 

I considered writing a separate program, a daemon that would monitor the database and perform maintenance, but I thought that was a bit much. Instead, I ended up adding the command `taggart database cleanup`, which allows multiple different "targets" to be run in a custom order. I added targets for deleting dangling references and hard-deleting soft deleted rows. 

This way, database operations remain as fast as they can be, and anyone concerned with cleaning up their database can either do so on command or configure a cron job to invoke the cleanup command on a schedule that makes sense to them. 

## Potential Improvements 

- logging providers 
- migrations 
- testing for each db implementation 
- benchmarking 


I'm pretty happy with my database implementation so far. Taggart supports a variety of database technologies who have EF10-compatible providers, including SQLite, SQL server, in memory, and file indexed. While Cosmos also has an EF10-compatible provider, its configuration is less trivial than just a connection string, so I've skipped over it for now. 

I ended up making several changes to the command-line syntax. 
- Tags are now managed using the syntax `taggart resource update /some/resource +newTag -oldTag` 
- Resource creation takes additional args for tags to apply upon creation, e.g. `taggart resource create /home/posh/pictures/cat.png cat image`
- The `tag` command has been gutted of most sub-commands, as explained later.

## Leveraging database constraints 

Letting the database manage unique constraints is easier as a developer and cheaper in terms of compute than validating uniqueness on create, so I decided to add unique constraints to ResourceTable.Uri and TagTable.Name. 

## The Maintenance Saga 

I noticed that a lot of maintenance doesn't actually require human intervention. For example, tags. There's no reason for a tag to exist if no resources reference it, so tag creation can actually be lumped in with when they're added to resources. Similarly, tags can essentially be garbage collected once their reference count drops to 0. 

I didn't want to perform this kind of maintenance in a command-blocking fashion whenever a reference to a tag was deleted, because that would become very slow as data scales. A similar thought occurred when considering tag deletion: even though there's an index on the junction table between tags and resources, so removing dead tag references would be fast, it could become slower as more tables come to reference TagTable, especially without relevant indices. 

I considered doing all of this in database triggers, but that would limit compatibility. I considered writing a separate daemon process to take care of the database, but that would be significant scope creep. Perhaps a command to perform database maintenance in several customisable steps? 

While testing other features and having this in the back of my mind, I noticed something strange: deleting a resource or tag would automatically 

## Slimming Down The Tag Command 

While tags can be deleted automatically when their reference count drops to 0, they can also be deleted manually, so the remove command for tags stays. 

Another required piece of functionality for tags is to rename. That was easy enough: `taggart tag rename oldName|ID newName`. The database architecture means we only have to rename it in one place, since everything else is just a reference to that name. 

Beside that? Creation is now automated when adding a non-existent tag to a resource; there isn't really any further data about a tag to read, beyond what's accomplished by querying resources; and I don't currently see a reason to be able to list tags. 

## Ditching Database IX 

In my original plan, I said I'd add commands `database import` and `database export`. I've since decided against this. Between the unix philosophy and not wanting to reinvent the wheel, I've decided that for now, database backups and imports can be handled by whichever database provider the user wants, though I'm open to reconsidering the idea if it starts to make more sense in future. 

## Testing &amp; Benchmarking 

Of all the projects I've ever written, I've had the best time testing this one. Part of it is the architecture, which inherently lends itself well to being testable in the application logic layer, but testing a CLI app really is so much better than testing a UI app, because the action stage is as easy as `new Program().Main([...]);`. 

Benchmarking was a little more difficult. There are a lot of things to consider while writing benchmarks: the size of the data, the specific database implementation, the state of the database... It could get out of hand quickly. I decided on the following: 

- I'll pick the provider at runtime. It won't be as easy to programmatically compare the performance of different database implementations, but it saves having to prepare an environment which supports them all for the time being. 
- I'll test only the most long-running operations: resource search and database cleanup targets. 
- I'll pull some big test data: a complete backup of e926. 

## Maintaining good docs 

Docs are like comments: They're lies waiting to happen. It's good to start documenting from the start, so you don't have to go back and assess the whole thing when it finally becomes too much of a pain to live without docs; but it's also difficult to keep them up to date, especially with a young and rapidly-evolving codebase. 

Luckily, a CLI app lends itself to documentation rather well, because users already expect to find help for any given feature by passing --help. This means that user documentation fits well living right alongside the code it describes, where I can see it as I create and edit features. 

I added some tests which discover commands, options, and arguments, and ensures that they all at least have some description. I considered writing something to enable the CI pipeline to format all the discoverable metadata into a document or wiki, but decided that was too much for now. 

The point here is, I dread to think what I'm going to have to come up with if I ever write a web API or GUI client.
